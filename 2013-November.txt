Subject: [Tstools-developer] tsplay and force packet lost ?
Message-ID: <1384420931.35510.YahooMailNeo@web171506.mail.ir2.yahoo.com>

Hi Tstools.

Is it possible to force a network degradation with tsplay ? 

I am streaming in RTP, and my client is ckecking to packet counter lost.
By using tsplay, I suppose I will have zero packet lost, but I am wondering if this streamer can force a lost packet percent ?? like netdisturb.

Best Regards,
Fr?d?ric
